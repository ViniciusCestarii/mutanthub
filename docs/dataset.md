How to obtain MutantHub data as a dataset: live exports, frozen snapshots, the row schema, and how to cite it.

# Dataset

MutantHub exists to produce a public dataset of mutants that survived real test suites, together
with the evidence and the community's reproductions. This page is written for researchers.

## Two ways to get the data

| Method          | URL                                                                     | Changes over time | Use for                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Live export** | `/api/export/mutants.json`, `/api/export/mutants.csv`                   | yes               | exploration, dashboards      |
| **Snapshot**    | `/api/datasets/<slug>/mutants.json`, `/api/datasets/<slug>/mutants.csv` | never             | papers, replication packages |

Live exports stream straight from the database and accept the same filters as the list API:
`project=owner/repo`, `language`, `operator`, `reviewStatus`, `mutationStatus`, `contributor`,
`commit`, `file`, `q`, plus `limit` (default 10,000, maximum 50,000). Example:

```bash
curl -sL "https://mutanthub.example.com/api/export/mutants.csv?project=curl/curl&reviewStatus=APPROVED" -o curl-mutants.csv
```

Snapshots are published by administrators from the **Dataset** page. Their rows are stored as
published, so later status changes never alter them, and each one carries a SHA-256 hash of the
canonical rows. Every snapshot has a permanent page (`/datasets/<slug>`) with a citation block.
Downloads send the hash in the `X-Dataset-Sha256` header and are cacheable forever.

## Row schema

JSON exports are an array of objects; CSV exports have one header row and RFC 4180 quoting
(multi-line diffs and commands are quoted, quotes are doubled). Columns, in order:

| Column                                                                                   | Meaning                                                                                                                                   |

New columns are only ever appended. Cells starting with `=` or `@` are prefixed with a quote to
defuse spreadsheet formulas; cells starting with `+` or `-` (diffs, code) are left intact, so
open CSV files as text in spreadsheet software.

## Reading the data correctly

- `mutationStatus = SURVIVED` means the recorded tests did not detect the mutant. It is not a
  verdict on the test suite: the mutant may be **equivalent**, environment-dependent, or simply
  not reproduced yet. Prefer rows with `reviewStatus = APPROVED` and at least one reproduction.
- `reviewStatus` and `mutationStatus` are independent. A mutant can be approved and killed.
- Conflicting reproductions show up as both `reproducedSurvived` and `reproducedKilled` being
  non-zero; the platform deliberately does not pick a winner.
- Per-mutant patches are available at `/api/mutants/<id>/patch` for reproduction.
- A `VERIFIED` kill claim means two independent reproductions killed the mutant at the claim's
  commit (or a reviewer confirmed it); the mutant's `mutationStatus` becomes `KILLED` at that
  point, with the claim referenced in its history.
- A `VERIFIED` kill claim means two independent reproductions killed the mutant at the claim's
  commit (or a reviewer confirmed it); the mutant's `mutationStatus` becomes `KILLED` at that
  point, with the claim referenced in its history.

## Citing

Cite a snapshot, not the live export. The snapshot page gives you the permanent URL, the
publication date, the row count and the hash:

```
MutantHub dataset snapshot "Surviving mutants, September 2026" (2026-09-15), 1234 mutants.
https://mutanthub.example.com/datasets/surviving-mutants-september-2026-2026-09-15
SHA-256 3b1f...
```

DOI minting (for example through Zenodo) can be layered on top of the same snapshot record.
